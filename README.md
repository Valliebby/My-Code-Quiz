# A multiple choice code quiz I created to showcase skills
# Code Quiz Showcase Demo

## A fully functional Code Quiz demo I created in code to showcase previous work and how to create a code quiz API.


As a developer I created a starer code using HTML, CSS, Java Script, and local storage to build and a demo quiz API, so users and fellow developers can test and challenge their skills or knowledge. Every part of this demo is simple code which shows an example on how to do the following: First I created a sign page with user storage using HTML skeleton, then CSS, Java. Then I created a functional quiz page HTML, CSS, and Java. In Java I started a timer function that went with quiz and end when timer was finished and custom questions in a Array to randomize. Then added a score function and a modal to input users high score. Thank you and I hope you enjoy!
